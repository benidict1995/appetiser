MVVM and Clean Architecture
- MVVM pattern separate view from the business logic.
- Kotlin DSL Plugin.
    - Plugin to extend projects capabilities, can do such as apply specific configuration, reuse and reduct the overhead of maintaining gradle projects.
    - I used kotlin dsl plugin to manage my dependencies, build logic and configurations for both app and library module and also it helps to lessen the process of gradle.
